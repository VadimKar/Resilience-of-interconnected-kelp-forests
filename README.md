OpenForests_CoreFunctions.R - includes code to simulate and analyze all simulations in the manuscript. 

OpenForests_CoreAnalyses.R - includes code to implement all analyses presented in Figures 2-5. Note that we ran most analyses on a computer cluster (typically 100-200 cores per analysis, with simulation times ~24h).
